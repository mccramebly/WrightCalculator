<H2 style="text-align:center;">The Power of Smart Calculators</H2>
<p>Some of us think Mathematics is the most beautiful subject in the world. For the rest, Math is not an end in itself. At worst it is an unnecessary impediment keeping students from getting a degree. At best it is a tool for finding answers. As such, we should be teaching our students the latest advances in technology and thereby leverage their ability to solve problems. For most people the benefits of the intellectual exercise associated with doing calculations by hand is far outweighed by the improved speed and accuracy of a technology based solution. A quill pen might be more visually pleasing for calligraphy, but a simple ball point pen is much more practical. Students benefit more from learning how to arrive at solutions using advanced technology than from memorizing arcane procedures from the dark ages. The purpose of my presentation is to introduce technology that is easily accessible and not all that difficult to use.</p>
<H2 style="text-align:center;">Progression of Technology</H2>
<p>So, let's look at a typical "math" problem. Let's find the square root of 2.759 using various forms of Math Technology starting with the tools used in 1950. Notice that the tools used in 1950 and 1970 have already been deprecated; they are no longer being taught. What we need to do is to move past the 1990 technology that is now in use and take advantage of technology introduced in the current millennium.
