        <h2>Foreword</h2>
        <p>I would like to begin by thanking the students who helped me with this project. It started out as programming assignments for students in Engineering 190, Introduction to Programming for Engineers. Subsequently I asked students in Math 99, 118, 125 and 140 to use the calculators and provide us with feedback. Students had complained that the Math curriculum spends too much time teaching process instead of concept and teaching archaic skills such as looking up cumulative distribution function values in a table. Both of these issues are eliminated by using a smart calculator.</p>
        <p>The programs are written in Javascript instead of some other programming language like Python, C++ or Java because it is currently the most universal language. It works on every O/S from Windows to Linux to MAC to Android.  All it needs is a browser like IE or Safari or FireFox or Chrome or Opera. It doesn't matter whether you are using a desktop, a laptop, a netbook, a pad or a smart phone. Students don't have to install any software. They can be writing working programs from the very first class meeting. </p> &nbsp;

                <h2>The Power of Smart Calculators</h2>
        <p>Some of us think Mathematics is the most beautiful subject in the world. For the rest, Math is not an end in itself. At worst it is an unnecessary impediment keeping students from getting a degree. At best it is a tool for finding answers. As such, we should be teaching our students the latest advances in technology and thereby leverage their ability to solve problems. For most people the benefits of the intellectual exercise associated with doing calculations by hand is far outweighed by the improved speed and accuracy of a technology based solution. A quill pen might be more visually pleasing for calligraphy, but a simple ball point pen is much more practical. Students benefit more from learning how to arrive at solutions using advanced technology than from memorizing arcane procedures from the dark ages. The purpose of my presentation is to introduce technology that is easily accessible and not all that difficult to use.</p>&nbsp;
    <h2>Progression of Technology</h2>
        <p>So, let's look at a typical "math" problem. Let's find the square root of 2.759 using various forms of Math Technology starting with the tools used in 1950. Notice that the tools used in 1950 and 1970 have already been deprecated; they are no longer being taught. What we need to do is to move past the 1990 technology that is now in use and take advantage of technology introduced in the current millennium.</p>

<h2>1950: Using a Slide Rule</h2> 
<img src="sliderule.jpg" width="" height="" alt="sliderule" title="sliderule" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>

<p>A slide rule is a mechanical analog computer. Typically it gives a precision of two significant figures, and the user estimates the third figure. Some high-end slide rules have magnifier cursors that give more significant digits.<br>Each scale gives the results for various calculations.  In this picture we set the start of the C scale to the value 1.39 on the D scale and we can read out six values under the cursor. The value is an eye-ball estimate based on the two marks to the either side of the cursor on the scale.</p> 

<p>Scale is calculation : Mark 1 &lt; value &lt; Mark 2</p>
<ul>
<li>K is D³ : 4.5 &lt; 4.583 &lt; 4.7</li>

<h2>1970: Four function calculators</h2>
<img alt="4 function" title="4 function"/>

    <p>Four function calculators such as the TI Datamath made it possible to multiply and divide many more digits than a slide rule could. They were not programmed to take square roots, but there were tricks one could use to find the square root, such as Newton's formula x = (x • x + N)/(2x).</p> <p>To take the square root of N you would pick some initial guess for x and apply the formula over and over again until successive values of x were close to each other. Typically two or three iterations give an accurate result.</p> 
    <p><a href="calc.htm?N=2.759;x=2;y=x*x;y=y+N;y=y/2;x=y/x;x=(x*x+N)/2/x;x=(x*x+N)/2/x;x=(x*x+N)/2/x;x^2" target="julius">Example:</a> to take the square root of N = 2.759</p>
<ol><li>First step, start with any random value for x, like x = 2<ul><li>
times x = 4</li><li>
plus  N = 6.759</li><li>
divide by 2 = 3.3795</li><li>
divide by x = 1.68975</li></ul>
so we get: x = 1.68975</li><li>
repeat:  x = 1.6612679575380973</li><li>
again: x = 1.6610237986294998</li><li>
and finally: x = 1.6610237806846717</li></ol>
then, to verify the answer:
1.6610237806846717² = 2.7590000000000003

    <h2>1990: Scientific calculators</h2>
            <p>Wow! It's like we had died and gone to Heaven! One push of the button and we get incredible precision.</p>
                <a href="../graduate/CASIO.fx115ms.HTM" target="julius"><img src="../graduate/fx115.jpg" alt="Casio calculator" title="Casio calculator"/></a>&nbsp;
            <p>Scientific calculators were soon followed by graphing calculators and programmable calculators. </p>
            <p>However, for whatever reason, the Math curriculum is currently stuck here. Sure, these calculators can do a lot for you, but they are not easy to use and they waste valuable keyboard space on some fairly useless functions like base ten logarithms. Math courses have not yet graduated to the next step by using smart calculators with an intuitive interface.</p><p>Smart calculators can do all of the things scientific calculators can do:</p>&nbsp;
            <p><a href="calc.htm?sqrt(2.759)" target="julius">√(2.759) =</a> 1.6610237806846715</p>

            <p>But they can do so much more.  Let's take a look at some of these capabilities.</p>&nbsp;</div>
        
        
<div class="artmenu"><h2><big>2010: Smart calculators</big></h2><h2>What makes them so smart</h2>
<p>All of us use smart software. Anytime you want a computer to do something for you without you having to tell it how it is to be done, you are using smart software. For example, you are using smart software when you use a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to click on an icon instead of entering a command line. Other examples are when you use a search engine to find something when you aren't too sure what you are looking for, or when your word processor checks your spelling as you are typing, or when gmail offers to look up an address in an incoming email. Software like Wolfram Alpha tries to anticipate what you are looking for and will tell you everything it knows relating to any topic. So when you ask it about 
<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=the+root+of+all+evil&t=elg01" target="julius"> "the root of all evil"</a> it will tell you:</p>
    <p><i>Assuming the input is the phrase instead of the television series or a music album or a music work then "the root of all evil" ...is the love of money.
        (The quote "Money is the root of all evil" is misattributed to Jesus Christ; it was actually stated as "The love of money is the root of all evil" by the Apostle Paul in his letter to Timothy in 1 Timothy 6:10.)</i></p>
        <p>Smart software tries to be helpful by telling you everything it knows instead of having you specify what information you need. So let's look at some of the things that a smart calculator like the Wright Calculator can do for you.</p> &nbsp;

            <p>Students taking physics, chemistry and other science classes are often expected to find solutions for equations involving transcendental functions.  For example a student may need to find all the values of x for which <em>e</em><sup>x/4</sup> is equal to 4cos(x)+5. Using the <strong>Wright College Smart Calculator</strong> you could graph both of these functions and locate the points where they are equal, like this:</p>
            <p><strong>input:</strong> x:0 to 14;y:-2 to 13;e^(x/4);4cos(x)+5 to get the <a href="graphs.htm?x:0 to 14;y:-2 to 13;e^(x/4);4cos(x)+5" target="julius"><strong>result</strong></a></p>
            <p>or you could graph the difference between the two functions and see where the difference is equal to zero:</p>
            <p><strong>input:</strong> x:0 to 14;y:-8 to 49;e^(x/4)-(4cos(x)+5) to get the <a href="graphs.htm?x:0 to 14;y:-8 to 49;e^(x/4)-(4cos(x)+5)" target="julius"><strong>result</strong></a> </p>
            <p>In either case, with the <strong>Wright College Smart Calculator</strong> you would need to zero in on the intersection point to see where it might be. A more sophisticated smart calculator such as <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=e%5E%28x%2F4%29-%284cos%28x%29%2B5%29">Wolfram alpha</a> will not only give you several graphs, but it will also suggest alternate forms for both real and imaginary values of x, the three numerical roots, the domain of the function, the Taylor series expansion at x=0 (also known as a Maclaurin series), the derivative, the indefinite integral, differential geometric curves, differential equation solution curve families and on and on, all without asking. All we have to teach our students is what this means and how to interpret it. No, they do not have to know how to "do it by hand."</p>
            <p>The <strong>Wright College Smart Calculator</strong> can also do some of this for you. For example, although it takes more effort, a student can be shown how numerical roots can be gotten via the Newton Ralphson calculator:</p>
            <p><strong>input:</strong> e^(X/4)-(4*cos(X)+5);2;4;7 to get the <a href="newton.htm?e^(X/4)-(4*cos(X)+5);2;4;7" target="julius"><strong>result</strong></a></p>
