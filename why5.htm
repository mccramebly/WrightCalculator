All of us use smart software. Anytime you want a computer to do something for you without you having to tell it how it is to be done, you are using smart software. For example, you are using smart software when you use a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to click on an icon instead of entering a command line. Other examples are when you use a search engine to find something when you aren't too sure what you are looking for, or when your word processor checks your spelling as you are typing, or when gmail offers to look up an address in an incoming email. Software like Wolfram Alpha tries to anticipate what you are looking for and will tell you everything it knows relating to any topic. So when you ask it about 
<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=the+root+of+all+evil&t=elg01" target="julius"> "the root of all evil"</a> it will tell you:<br>
<i>Assuming the input is the phrase instead of the television series or a music album or a music work then "the root of all evil" ...is the love of money. <br>(The quote "Money is the root of all evil" is misattributed to Jesus Christ; it was actually stated as "The love of money is the root of all evil" by the Apostle Paul in his letter to Timothy in 1 Timothy 6:10.)</i>
<p>Smart software tries to be helpful by telling you everything it knows instead of having you specify what information you need. So let's look at some of the things that a smart calculator like the Wright Calculator can do for you.</p>
