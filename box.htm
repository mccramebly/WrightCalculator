        A multiset is a collection of unordered elements, where every element occurs a finite number of times.<br>
        Let's say you have four different types of boxes identified as type 
        <span class="red">A</span>, <span class="green">B</span>, <span class="blue">C</span>, and <span class="purple">D</span><br>
        How many different multisets of 5 boxes can you have? <br>Here are four, shown three different ways:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Boxes</th>
            <th>box counts</th>
            <th>stars and stripes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr align=center>
            <td>
                <span class="blue">C</span> <span class="blue">C</span> <span class="purple">D</span> <span class="purple">D</span> <span class="purple">D</span>
            </td>
            <td>2C3D</td>
            <td>||**|***</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align=center>
            <td> 
                <span class="red">A</span> 
                <span class="blue">C</span> 
                <span class="blue">C</span> 
                <span class="blue">C</span> 
                <span class="purple">D</span>
            </td>
            <td>1A3C1D</td>
            <td>*||***|*</td>
        </tr>

            <td>1A1B2C1D</td>
            <td>*|*|**|*</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align=center>
            <td> 
                <span class="red">A</span> 
                <span class="red">A</span> 
                <span class="red">A</span> 
                <span class="red">A</span> 
                <span class="red">A</span>
            </td>

    <p>Answer: <br>
        let's introduce a new notation:  ((4,5)) to represent 5 choices of 4 different box types.<br>
        The stars and stripes presentation has us using five stars separated by three lines into four groups where the first set of stars are the A's separated with a line from the B's, then the C's and finally the D's.<br>
        Since we are selecting 5 of the 5+3 symbols to be stars, combinatorics tells us that there are nCr(8,5) = 56 possible multisets.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the Analysis performed by the program. <br>Note that the four examples from above are shown in bold.</p>
    <p>4 types of boxes, 5 selected, nCr(8,5) = 56 ways<br>
