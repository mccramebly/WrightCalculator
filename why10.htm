Students taking physics, chemistry and other science classes are often expected to find solutions for equations involving transcendental functions.  For example a student may need to find all the values of x for which <i>e</i><sup>x/4</sup> is equal to 4cos(x)+5. Using the <b>Wright College Smart Calculator</b> you could graph both of these functions and locate the points where they are equal, like this:<br>
<b>input:</b> x:0 to 14;y:-2 to 13;e^(x/4);4cos(x)+5 to get the 
<a href="graphs.htm?x:0 to 14;y:-2 to 13;e^(x/4);4cos(x)+5" target="julius"><b>result</b></a><br>
or you could graph the difference between the two functions and see where the difference is equal to zero:<br>
<b>input:</b> x:0 to 14;y:-8 to 49;e^(x/4)-(4cos(x)+5) to get the 
<a href="graphs.htm?x:0 to 14;y:-8 to 49;e^(x/4)-(4cos(x)+5)" target="julius"><b>result</b></a> 
<br>
In either case, with the <b>Wright College Smart Calculator</b> you would need to zero in on the intersection point to see where it might be. A more sophisticated smart calculator such as <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=e%5E%28x%2F4%29-%284cos%28x%29%2B5%29">Wolfram alpha</a> will not only give you several graphs, but it will also suggest alternate forms for both real and imaginary values of x, the three numerical roots, the domain of the function, the Taylor series expansion at x=0 (also known as a Maclaurin series), the derivative, the indefinite integral, differential geometric curves, differential equation solution curve families and on and on, all without asking. All we have to teach our students is what this means and how to interpret it. No, they do not have to know how to "do it by hand."<br><br>
The <b>Wright College Smart Calculator</b> can also do some of this for you. For example, although it takes more effort, a student can be shown how numerical roots can be gotten via the Newton Ralphson calculator:<br>
<b>input:</b> e^(X/4)-(4*cos(X)+5);2;4;7 to get the  
<a href="newton.htm?e^(X/4)-(4*cos(X)+5);2;4;7" target="julius"><b>result</b></a>
